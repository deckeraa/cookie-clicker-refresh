# cookie-clicker-refresh

This is a tool that can be used to "save-scum" plants in the garden mini-game in Cookie Clicker.
It will take a screenshot, look for a specified plant, and hit F5 if it is not found.
It does then in a loop and terminates when it sees the plant.

(Though it was mainly an excuse to play around with OpenCV).

## Usage

1) Load up the REPL.
2) When your garden is set up for a mutation that you want, wait till the time reaches two seconds, then hit save.
3) Switch to the REPL and run `(refresh-till "Chocoroot_bud.png")` (or whatever other plant you want it to search for).
4) Immediately switch back to the browser screen so that it can be screenshotted and so that the F5 keystroke this tool does will refresh the browser.
